# Latin-Indirect-Speech - Ben Miller
Analysis of indirect speech use in Latin

# Overview
This project seeks to examine the syntax of indirect speech in Latin, and how it differs between authors and eras.
The dataset used is the [PROIEL Treebank](https://dev.syntacticus.org/), a corpus with 225,064 tokens of Latin data,
as well as other classical Indo-European languages.

The texts used are as follows:

* Gaius Julius Caesar - *Commentaries on the Gallic Wars*
* Marcus Tullius Cicero - *De officiis*
* Marcus Tullius Cicero - *Letters to Atticus*
* *Peregrinatio Aetheriae*
* Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius - *Opus agriculturae*
